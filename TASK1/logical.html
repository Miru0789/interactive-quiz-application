    "explanation": "Let Mary's age be x. Then John's is 2x. 5 years ago: 2x-5 = 3(x-5) → x = 10."

    "questionText": "If some Smibs are Smobs and all Smobs are Smebs, then some Smibs are definitely Smebs?",
    "options": ["True", "False", "Cannot be determined", "None of the above"],

    "options": ["36", "38", "40", "42"],
